					<p class="centers subh marginbottom40">Because this project was short on time, I realized that I couldn’t add all the features I wanted to, and 
						truly understood the importance of MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Initially, my goals were to make mockups and prototypes for both mobile and 
						desktop and go much deeper into the user stories and flows. However, I decided to go through the user stories and decided what really mattered 
						most at the start of the app.</p>
					<p class="centers subh">Lastly, learning from my mistakes on my last project (Mikumo), I ignored what I thought or assumed and decided to take it 
						to heart whatever the surveys showed and what the users had to say after the testing and the project moved exceptionally fast and with very few 
						errors.</p>
