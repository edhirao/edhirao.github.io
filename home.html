            <p>Hey what's up! I'm Eduardo! The Japanese-Brazilian Unicorn Developer. My life so far has been a bit odd compared to many but if you're down to listen to my life  story here we go!</p>
            <p>I moved to Michigan when I was only 11 years old from São Paulo( the largest city in Brazil). While in school I was a pretty active kid -- joining the track & field and swimming club in middle school( I tried out for the basketball team, but I failed terribly). Later in high school I joined the soccer team my freshman year, track & field my senior year, and wrestling all four years.</p>
            <p>After high school craving for some excitement and wanting to do something that matter I joined the most elite military branch in the US, the Marines. On January 5th, 2009 I went to boot camp for 13 weeks and was one of the 6 recruits out of the 80 that earned a meritorious promotion to Private First Class.</p>
            <p>On May 2010 I was deployed to Helmand Province, Afghanistan with the 1/11 HQ and later to Sangin with 1/11 Bravo. While I was on deployment I was promoted to the rank of Corporal( 4 months before my 2-year mark in service). At the end of November of the same year my deployment to Afghanistan ended and I was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, and a couple of extra medals and ribbons to stack on my uniform.</p>
            <p>I left the Marines back in 2013, I went to community college to learn architecture and web development. Although I did study Web Design in High School (back in 2003), it was only after I left the Marines that I became fascinated with Web Design/Web Development. I was amazed at how a bunch of letters and numbers all piled up together could created something so artistic, and later I found out that video games were created in the same manner! Fast forward to now, I'm learning one subject at a time, not just code, but anything there is to learn.</p>
