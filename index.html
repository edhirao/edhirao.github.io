				<section class="col-sm-12 subphase">
					<section class="biobox">
						<h3 class="bio-subh">The Origin</h3>
						<p class="bio-p">For as long as I can remember, if I didn’t have a ball at my feet or was running* on the streets of Brazil, I was drawing with 
							a pencil in my hand. I remember drawing Pokémon and Knights of the Zodiac (an anime extremely popular in Brazil) for hours. Art 
							was such a huge part of my life that I would go in drawing competitions, and in middle school one of my clay sculpture was displayed in a 
							mall near my house for a few days. But somewhere along the line I lost the passion I once had and focused all my energy in sports.</p>
					</section>	
					<section class="biobox">
						<h3 class="bio-subh">Platoon Ten-Hut!</h3>
						<p class="bio-p">I tried following in my father’s footsteps as a mechanical engineer, but I quickly learned that I had no aptitude or desire to become one. 
							Feeling somewhat lost, I joined the Marines. I was rapidly promoted to PFC, and in the two years after I left boot camp, I picked the rank 
							of Lance Corporal and then became Corporal. As a young Corporal I was assigned as the Field Mess NCOIC (Non-Commissioned Officer In Charge). 
							As the Field Mess NCOIC, I had the freedom to experiment with ways to make the food more pleasing and improve the overall sanitation while 
							in garrison and on deployments. In Afghanistan I designed a cup dispenser out of cardboard box that allowed the marines to twist and pull 
							for a single cup. I called that invention the Twist n’ Pull. </p>

						<p class="bio-p">My other design was dubbed the Shake n’ Take, and was a plastic utensil dispenser that the marines would shake and any plastic utensil set 
							that was stuck inside would fall, allowing the other sets to stay clean.  I had tried another experiment in Afghanistan that later set a 
							new standard, at least in my unit, and involved cooking the dehydrated eggs. The dehydrated eggs were easy to make - you add water and put 
							them inside the tray ration heater. But often times the eggs would’ve come out watery (too much water), or hard (not enough water). Luckily 
							one of our Corpsman had a rice cooker and I was able to borrow it every morning. To make the eggs even better, I asked all the marines in 
							the base to save their MRE (Meal Ready to Eat) cheese, so I could use it for the eggs. Thanks to the rice cooker the eggs came out perfectly 
							so no more eggs or MRE Cheeses were thrown away. Although this is not directly related to design, it did solve a few problems while in 
							Afghanistan: sanitation, food waste, and food quality, and this greatly boosted the morale.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="biobox">
						<h3 class="bio-subh">Help! I've Fallen and I Can't Get Up!</h3>
						<p class="bio-p">Once I left the marines I immediately started attending school for architecture. While I was in architecture school I was doing exceptionally 
							well, however, after a few years, the school decided to terminate the architecture program due to the low student enrollment. When I received 
							that notice, I panicked and dropped out soon after. Luckily a few months later I decided to sell the house I had bought in SoCal during the 
							recession, and I used that money to start day trading. Initially things went well, but after a few desperate moves cost me greatly, I decided 
							to cut my losses.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="biobox">
						<h3  class="bio-subh">UX? What's That?</h3>
						<p class="bio-p">With the end of my day trading journey I decided to learn more about front-end d*evelopment since I already had some experience with HTML and 
							CSS. But the more I learned about web development, words like UX, UI, Information Architecture started coming up in my searches, and the 
							more I realised how much UX fit with my personality. I spent hours, sometimes even seeing the sunrise, looking at websites from other 
							designers and companies, and thinking of how my next project would look. I started doing more research on UX and discovered that it wasn’t 
							just art, like the drawings and sculptures I’ve been doing since I was a kid, but also functionality, like all the solutions I came up with 
							while I was in the Marines. It was a combination of art and functionality brought together, similar to what I was doing as an architect 
							student. Right then I realized that this whole time design was all around me, and I had never given up on art or design.</p>
